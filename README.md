This is the code I have written whilst following the Book Crafting Intepreters that contains additional comments that I felt were necessasry for my personal learning. The main branch is going to consist of sequential chapter content of the second part of the book, meanwhile branches will consist of exercises I have accomplished that involve code. 

This github repo is mainly so I don't lose my work, but if it is in breach of any laws, I would be happy to remove it.
